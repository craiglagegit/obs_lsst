This package should be tested via a `ci_lsst` package.

This is being prepared, but is not yet in git or runnable automatically.  On lsst-dev, see
     /project/rhl/Data/ci_lsst
where data is available to test
     auxTel
     imsim
     phosim
and (soon)
     ts8

After
     setup -m /project/rhl/Data/ci_lsst/ups/ci_lsst.table
Run
     /project/rhl/Data/ci_lsst/bin/runPipeline [cameras]
e.g.
     /project/rhl/Data/ci_lsst/bin/runPipeline imsim

to ingest, generate calibs, run the isr, and run processCcd.  If you omit the list of cameras, all will be
run.
