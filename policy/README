This directory contains the files needed to describe cameras made up of LSST chips.  The eventual goal is to
describe the real camera, but for now we also have variants to handle phosim and imsim simulations (they
differ in e.g. the gain and crosstalk values).

Once Butler Gen3 is ready this configuration data will be moved out of the obs package and into the
calibration registry, which will allow us to track evolution of the system (including replacing failed
rafts -- not that that's going to happen).


The basic strategy is that the SConscript file in the directory assembles a suitable camera.yaml file
(e.g. phosim.yaml) and we put the appropriate entry in the _mapper file in the data repository.

To add a new camera (e.g. comCam, made up of 9 CCDs in a single "raft" -- call it RXX for now):
 - Add a directory policy/comCam (n.b. the file you are reading is policy/README)
 - Put a file rafts.yaml in that directory describing RXX (you can start with policy/rafts.yaml).
 - Put a file RXX.yaml in policy.comCam (you can start with lsstCam/R11.yaml).  Note that you can
   choose an ITL or E2V device.  Note that you must provide a serial number for each CCD in the raft
   as that's how I know how many CCDs there are in the "raft" (e.g. auxTel has only one)
 - If you're plagued by crosstalk, put a file ccdData.yaml in policy/comcam.  Look at the one in
   policy/phosim for the format -- basically a dict crosstalk indexed by the CCD type.  There
   are 256 coefficients (16 amplifiers and 256 == 16^2), and we assume for now that all CCDs from
   a given vendor are the same (but the fix to generateCamera.py to handle per-CCD coefficients
   would be easy)
 - Edit policy/SConscript to add your new camera "comcam" to the `for camera in ...` loop.
   note the magic `--path` options -- it tells the code to use your data in comcam to override
   lsstCam values.  This is why there's no imsim directory and phosim only contains the crosstalk
   coefficients; they take almost everything from policy and policy/lsstCam
 - run scons in the obs_lsstCam directory (or scons -u in policy)
 - add comcam.yaml to policy/.gitignore
 - Create a new file python/lsst/obs/lsstCam/comCam.py (see auxTel.py for an example)
   and add a class ComCam.  Note that you need to change the path for cameraYamlFile, presumably to
   "comcam.yaml" -- you don't need to create this file; it's the one you named in the previous step.
   Now add a class ComCamMapper to the same file.  Look at the example in
   python/lsst/obs/lsstCam/auxTel/auxTel.py -- you'll see that this overrides some entries in
   lsstCamMapper.yaml (in the class data member yamlFileList) with auxTelMapper.yaml.
   If want to provide your own templates you'll need to do the same thing, adding a file
   `policy/comCamMapper.yaml".
   
   Remember to update _makeCamera to call ComCam(), and getCameraName to return "comCam"; this name
   is used to e.g. provide per-camera configuration files (for example config/auxTel/ingest.py)
 - Put a _mapper file in the root of your repository, containing lsst.obs.lsstCam.comCam.ComCamMapper
 - You may well need your own ParseTask.  Add it to python/lsst/obs/lsstCam/comCam.py (once more
   you'll find an example in auxTel.py) and retarget config.parse in config/comCam/ingest.py

If my instructions are complete and correct you are good to go. Once you're happy commit all
your changes to git and push.
